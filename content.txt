What is component?
- Building blocks of react
- Reusable piece of code which consist JSX (UI) and Javascript as a business logic
- Types => Functional component (>16.8) | Class components (Till 16.8) 

Reasons Functionals components=>
1. Simpler syntax
2. Easy to understand, implement and learn
3. Capable to make an Facebook like application

JSX - Javascript extensible langugage
1. Your JSX should return one parent element only. (cleared)
2. All tags in JSX should be closed. <img src=""> = x | <img src="" /> (cleared)
3. class/for => JSX : className / htmlFor. (cleared)
4. html attributes => camelCase (onClick, className, onMouseOver, etc) (Will be coevered in event listener lecture)
5. Inline styles should be in object. (cleared)

PROPS (Properties) -
1. To pass data(state, JS variable, JS function, array, objects anything) from parent component to child component. 
2. Name from passing component to accepting should be exactly same else it will throw error.

Styles =>
External and Inline
Internal = does not exist in react js

Interview:-
1. Difference between normals functions and arrow functions => this keyword
2. Write polyfill(implementation of whatever concept in JS) of map function ? (advance)
